# syncComputers

This is a repo created to sync my laptop and desktop home directories, snap packages, and apt packages. I push/pull changes to/from a remote server (in this case it's a raspberry pi with a disk attached).  

## WARNING
Both my laptop and PC run on Ubuntu 22.04. I can't guarentee this script will work as intended for you if you use a different linux distribution and/or different package managers. Modify the scripts as you see fit to be compatible with your directory structure, the directory you cloned this into, and your package managers.  

## Description
`rsync` is used to sync the home directories.  
`exclude.txt` includes all the directories and files to exclude from `rsync`. Manually edit to your content.  
`apt.txt` includes all the packages explicitly installed via the apt package manager.  
`snap.txt` includes all the snap packages installed.  
`other.txt` includes all other commands to run to fill in gaps as needed. Manually edit to your content.  
`pushHome.sh` is the script used to push changes to the remote server.  
`pullHome.sh` is the script used to pull changes from the remote server.  

You may additionally configure a `cronjob` and/or a `systemd` service to run either of these scripts automatically on a schedule or at startup.
