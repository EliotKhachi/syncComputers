# syncComputers

This is a repo containing some scripts I use to sync my laptop and desktop home directories and software packages. I push and pull changes to and from a remote server.  

WARNING: Both my laptop and PC run on Ubuntu 22.04. Be careful when running these scripts, as your filesystem is probably not identical to mine. Modify the scripts as you see fit to enforce compatibility.   

It's worth mentioning that `rsync` is generally pretty safe to use, as it doesn't delete files or directories-- *but* it WILL overwrite files if they are the same name and in the same location.   
## Configuration
When modifying files in this repo to suit your needs, consider the following:  
* What server/network file system are you using? Connect it to your network and configure an SSH connection to it. I'm using a raspberry pi with an external disk.  
* What are the filesystem structures of *all* machines involved?   
* What package manager do your local machines use?  
* rename the `$repo` variable in `pull.sh` and `push.sh` to where you cloned this repo.  
* specify directories and files to exclude from `rsync` in `exclude.txt`.  
* negate anything in `exclude.txt` with `include.txt`.   
* `other.sh` includes all other commands to run to fill in gaps as needed. Manually edit to your content.  

## push.sh
* pushes local home directory to server with `rsync` and outputs `push.log`.  
* It also updates the `apt` and `snap` package lists.  
* Creates a git commit  
## pull.sh
* pulls the latest git repo  
* pulls server home directory with `rsync` and outputs `pull.log`.  
* Installs packages specified in `apt.txt` and `snap.txt` and any others specified in `other.sh`  
* Creates a git commit
